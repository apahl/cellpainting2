# Tools for Processing Results from CellPainting Assay

IMPORTANT: This package is very much WIP and probably not yet usable by others. Breaking changes are introduced on a daily basis and there is not yet an easy setup.

This is a set of tools used for processing results generated by [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org) for the CellPainting asssay.

The tools are designed to be used in a Jupyter Notebook and have been written in Python3.
The starting point is a `Results.tsv` file that contains output from a CellProfiler pipeline aggregated as medians on site level (please visit [cellprofiler.org](https://cellprofiler.org/) for details on how to setup and run CellProfiler pipelines).

Further documentation, including Jupyter Notebooks with example workflows, will follow.

## CellPainting 2
* Switch from a categorical fingerprint to a continuous log2-fold scale
* Use 629 parameters selected based on reproducibility
    - do not remove correlated parameters
