# Tools for Processing Results from CellPainting Assay

This is a set of tools used for processing results generated by [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org) for the CellPainting asssay.

The tools are designed to be used in a Jupyter Notebook and have been written in Python3.
The starting point is a `Results.tsv` file that contains the CellProfiler output aggregated as means on site level.

Further documentation, including Jupyter Notebooks with example workflows, will follow.
